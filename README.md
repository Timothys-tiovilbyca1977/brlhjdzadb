Just wobbled out of the theater, man. My mind's a whole circus. Havoc — what a rollercoaster and not in the fun way, like motion sickness mixed with cotton candy overdose. My back’s aching from those rigid seats. Seriously, they should replace those with hammocks or something. 

The opening was like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a sim hold up a control tower, all lights and loud chaos. People around me munching popcorn like they were filing taxes, all methodical and loud. The guy next to me, I swear, had a hole in his popcorn bag, dropped crumbs everywhere. It’s like the aftermath of a pigeon party down here.

> Then this biker dude, the hero, I guess, with his jawline so sharp it could cut my overdue fishing line. Blasts of music, I could barely hear my thoughts over the explosive soundtrack. Everything just blurring into each other, like a watercolor painting left in the rain.

Is it just me or did they 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 all those chase scenes while riding on the back of a frightened rabbit? Bouncing all over, almost felt like the camera guy was having his own little adventure. Gritty and raw like catching a slippery fish with your bare hands. Reminded me of that feeling when you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 a   and halfway through forget what you wanted to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩.

Oh, and there was this one scene I’m just trying to piece together—hero dude just falling, endlessly, like Alice down the rabbit hole but less whimsical and more like when my tackle box tipped over the pier. My phone buzzed then, oh someone asked about 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 or 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   and now I can’t remember.

The dialogue felt like they wrote it after eating stale cereal. Phrases that stick but don’t mean much, like soggy cornflakes. I swear, if half my fishing conversations were this cryptic, I’d get tangled in my own net. 

Last bit had me feeling like I accidentally set my reel on fast-forward. Flashes of light, explosions, too loud. It’s like someone cranked the volume on the universe’s boombox. Seriously felt like my brain was a goldfish gulping air at that point.

Somehow it's like I’m still bobbing along with the noise, like seaweed in choppy water. Don’t know if I’ll 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again or just tell tales of its chaos like a stormy night out at sea.
